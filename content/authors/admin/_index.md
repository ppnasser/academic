My passion lies in solving real-world problems guided by data.

I consider myself too much of a generalist for a specialist, and too much of a specialist for a generalist. The reason? I have experience in highly diverse areas such as the financial market, quantitative research, the public sector, digital products, and corporate finance, all while pursuing a Master's in Statistics and holding a Bachelor's degree in Economics.

My current focus revolves around data-driven innovation: tackling business challenges through analytical solutions, models, and/or data products.
